## Welcome to CancelMyMeal

This ongoing project targets regular mess costumers and vendors who serve meals on the regular basis.
In this project, we're creating a Mobile app platform which posses some great features like the meal of a particular day automatically gets cancelled using some complex machine algorithms after observing this behaviour of that person. Its major feature is behaviour based meal prediction for a day through which vendors can also estimate their regular consumption. 
We are also planning for using blockchain technology for making database and social networks for making predictions more accurate and precised.
