### Welcome to CancelMyMeal
```markdown

This ongoing project targets regular mess costumers and vendors who serve meals on
the regular basis.
In this project, we're creating a Mobile app platform which posses some great 
features like the meal of a particular day automatically gets cancelled using 
some complex machine algorithms after observing this behaviour of that person. 
Its major feature is behaviour based meal prediction for a day through which 
vendors can also estimate their regular consumption.

We are also planning for using blockchain technology for our database and 
social networks for making predictions more accurate and precised.
